Display CSS3 style buttons on your website using shortcodes or PHP function call.

== Description ==

<strong>Update: As of version 0.0.2, there is a new way to call the plugin from PHP. If you are currently calling the plugin from your functions.php or another plugin, please read the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/standout-css3-buttons/faq/">FAQ</a>.

Based on <a href="http://www.briangardner.com/social-media-buttons/">this blog post from Brian Gardner</a>, display cool CSS3 style gradient buttons on your site using shortcodes.

You can also call the plugin in your functions.php or in a plugin. Choose from several different social media color styles.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin through the WordPress interface.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Go to Settings &raquo; Standout CSS3 Buttons and configure the plugin.

4. Insert shortcode on posts or pages, or call the plugin from your PHP code.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plugin? =

Use a shortcode to call the plugin from any page or post like this:

`[standout-css3-button class="button-dribbble" href="http://www.google.com/"]Click here[/standout-css3-button]`

This will output the following:

`<a class="button-dribbble" href="http://www.google.com/">Click here</a>`

You may also include shortcodes within the shortcode.

The shortcode can also be used in your PHP code (functions.php, or a plugin) using the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode">do_shortcode</a> function, ex:

`echo do_shortcode('[standout-css3-button class="button-dribbble" href="http://www.google.com/"]Click here[/standout-css3-button]');`

You can also call the PHP function like this:

`add_action('the_content', 'show_css3_button');
function show_css3_button($content) {
  if (is_page('home')) {
    scss3button(array('class' => 'button-rss', 'href' => 'http://www.google.com/', 'show' => true), 'Click here');
  }
}`

= What are the plugin defaults? =

By default, following values are passed to the plugin:

- enabled => true
- style => dribble
- url => ''
- nofollow => true

To change defaults on a site-wide basis, go to the Settings page. To change defaults on a per-shortcode basis, pass new values to each shortcode or function call. 

= What styles are available? =

The following styles are available.

<ul>
<li>button-dribbble (default)</li>
<li>button-facebook</li>
<li>button-googleplus</li>
<li>button-linkedin</li>
<li>button-pinterest</li>
<li>button-rss</li>
<li>button-tumblr</li>
<li>button-twitter</li>
</ul>

= I added the shortcode to a page but I don't see anything. =

Clear your browser cache and also clear your cache plugin (if any). If you still don't see anything, check your webpage source for the following:

`<!-- Standout CSS3 Buttons: plugin is disabled. Check Settings page. -->`

This means you didn't pass a necessary setting to the plugin. For color buttons, you must specify the URL. You should also check that the "enabled" checkbox on the plugin settings page is checked.

= I don't want the post editor toolbar buttons. How do I remove them? =

Add this to your functions.php:

`remove_action('admin_print_footer_scripts', 'add_scss3b_quicktag');`
